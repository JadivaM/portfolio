## My portfolio!

- This is my portfolio which is also a Yelp clone using React, Express, Node.js, CSS. Additional resources used to style some components include Material-ui and Material-ui icons and various fonts in order to make it look as similar as possible to the Yelp website including attempting to clone the Yelp logo using CSS.

## How to use

-Once navigating to the homepage my recent projects will be available to click into and explore. There will be various ways to navigate around the different pages via navbars and hovering over the search bars will prompt a dropdown to navigate around to home, all projects, and about me. 

## Available build commands

- `yarn server`: Runs JUST your Express.JS server.
- `yarn client`: Runs JUST your front-end React app.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view your local React app in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits.
